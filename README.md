#### Notes
- Navigation bar is not position-fixed or position-static.
- Only the functionality requested was completed.  Some of the navigation menu items lead to no actual web page.
- CDNs were used instead of the files in js and css folders.
- More info buttons are default size and the buttons and the captions are colored for readability.
- No logo was given for navigation bar brand, so text was used.

#### File information
Additional but unused files for Bootstrap are in js and css folders. (CDNs were used instead)
